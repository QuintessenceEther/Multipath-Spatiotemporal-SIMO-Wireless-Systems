# Multipath-Spatiotemporal-SIMO-Wireless-Systems
## Introduction
The main objective of this project is to simulate a QPSK-DS-CDMA communication system and design space-time array receivers to handle multipaths, suppress MAI (multiple access interference) and improve the overall capacity of the system.
